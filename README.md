### üìå TODO

### üìÅ Data Preparation
We use publicly available datasets from [DreamBooth](https://github.com/google/dreambooth), [CustomDiffusion](https://github.com/adobe-research/custom-diffusion), and [Textual Inversion](https://github.com/rinongal/textual_inversion) as our source of clean images. Example images can be found in the [`examples`](..) directory. For reproducibility, we provide a reference implementation for **adding watermarks** to images. Please refer to the provided code to see how watermarks are applied. Feel free to adapt the code for your own dataset and needs.
